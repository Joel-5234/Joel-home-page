# Ideas Document

## Original Idea
Build a complete static personal website for an 8th grade student named Joel Lopez. The site will be hosted on GitHub Pages and should be pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. No build tools. No frameworks.

## Reference Design
Use ./ref/html5up-ethereal/* as reference for the look and feel for the site.

## Key Features
- One-page design with smooth scrolling
- Responsive layout
- Project showcase
- Skills display
- Video placeholders
- Contact information

## Future Enhancements
- Add actual project videos
- Update project links as they become available
- Add more projects as Joel completes them
- Potentially add a blog section for updates
