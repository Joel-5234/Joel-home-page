                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>When I was younger, I used to watch my dad work for hours protecting his company's technology. He works as an Executive Director at MSCI and uses software to keep important systems running. Seeing how fast his programs generated code made me want to learn how technology works.</p>
                <p>I want to learn to code and design so I can build tools that help people and make the world better. I enjoy turning ideas into real things, whether it is a design, an animation, or a working prototype.</p>

                    <li>Learning Python and coding concepts</li>
                    <li>Swimming, pickleball, and golfing with my family</li>

                        <p>I am drawn to Industrial Design and Animation because it lets me turn ideas into real objects and stories. I like the mix of creativity and technology. I want to learn how to design products, create 3D models, and bring animations to life.</p>

                        <h3>Second Choice Major · Computer Programming</h3>
                        <p>Computer Programming interests me because it can change both the digital and physical world. I want to learn the fundamentals of coding so I can understand every line, not just use AI tools. My goal is to build apps and tools that help people learn, communicate, and solve real problems.</p>

                    <p>Long term, I want to design and build things that people use every day. That might be a game, a tool for students, or a product that helps a small business like my mom's coffee company. I want to combine design, animation, and programming to make useful and fun experiences.</p>

                        <h3>NFC Enabled 3D Print for Brew Point Coffee</h3>
                        <p>I designed a circular 3D printed tag that holds a 25 millimeter NFC chip. I modeled it in Onshape, printed it on a Bambu Labs P1S, paused the print to insert the NFC tag, and then used my iPhone to write a link to my mom's Brew Point coffee contact page. When you tap the tag with a phone, it opens the site instantly.</p>

                        <h3>Math Models Quiz App · Relations and Functions</h3>
                        <p>For my Math Models homework on relations and functions, I used Python and Cursor to build a quiz game. The app uses Streamlit to show questions like 'Is this a function?' or 'What is the domain and range?' It tracks my score and uses a timer so I can practice under pressure and make homework feel more like a game.</p>
